As a Full-Stack Developer I not only understand all the stages in the Software Development Life Cycle, I have experience with them as well. Through planning and gathering requirements, to early development with Alpha releases and then major releases, to deploying and maintaining my team's work. Each time through the cycle I learn something new. I continue to hone my skills and become even more passionate, driven, and enthusiastic about my work!",
