Which, to my knowledge, was used as a proof of concept for Parson's PeARL Flash 2 and to this day probably shares some of the same code. GeoBarista is a cross-platform open-source application built on web technology to sort/filter/view/convert geo-referenced imagery on a map. This allows the user to capture images with an ariel camera and overlay them on a map. This was done using a variety of GPS data and camera telemetry available from the photo's metadata",
